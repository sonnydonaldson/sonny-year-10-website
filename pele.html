<h1>Pele</h1>

<h3>Where he grew up</h3>

<P>Pele grew up in the povity city of Bauru, Brazil, in the state of São Paulo even though he was born in 
    Três Corações but he moved to Bauru when he was young. He would work in a tea shop as a servant to  earn some extra money.
    He was taught how to play football by his dad, he could not afford a real football so they would usually use a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with string or a grapefruit instead.
